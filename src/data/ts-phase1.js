      title: "Why TypeScript & Setup",
      explanation: `TypeScript is a **statically-typed superset of JavaScript** developed by Microsoft. Every valid JavaScript file is already valid TypeScript — TS adds an optional type layer that is **erased at compile time**, producing plain JavaScript.

**Why TypeScript matters in production:**
- Catches bugs **at compile time** instead of runtime — null reference errors, typos, wrong argument types
- Serves as **living documentation** — function signatures tell you exactly what goes in and comes out
- Enables **powerful IDE tooling** — autocompletion, refactoring, jump-to-definition across large codebases
- Scales to **large teams** — type contracts between modules prevent integration bugs

**How TypeScript works internally:**
1. You write \`.ts\` files with type annotations
2. The TypeScript compiler (\`tsc\`) **type-checks** the code
3. Types are **completely erased** — the output is plain JavaScript
4. No runtime overhead — TypeScript doesn't exist at runtime

**Comparison with JavaScript:** In JS, \`function add(a, b) { return a + b; }\` silently accepts \`add("hello", 5)\` → \`"hello5"\`. In TS, you declare \`function add(a: number, b: number): number\` and the compiler catches misuse before the code ever runs.

🏠 **Real-world analogy:** TypeScript is like spell-check for your code. The red squiggly lines catch mistakes as you type, but the final published document (JavaScript) doesn't contain any spell-check markup.`,
      codeExample: `// Install TypeScript
// npm install -g typescript
// npx tsc --init  (creates tsconfig.json)

// Basic type annotations
let message: string = "Hello, TypeScript!";
let count: number = 42;
let isActive: boolean = true;

// Type inference — TS figures out the type automatically
let inferred = "TypeScript infers this as string"; // type: string
let num = 100;  // type: number

// Function with type annotations
function greet(name: string): string {
  return \`Hello, \${name}!\`;
}

// greet(42);  // ❌ Compile error: Argument of type 'number'
//             //    is not assignable to parameter of type 'string'
greet("Alice"); // ✅ Works

// The compiled JavaScript output (types are erased):
// function greet(name) {
//   return \`Hello, \${name}!\`;
// }

// tsconfig.json essentials (starter):
// {
//   "compilerOptions": {
//     "target": "ES2022",
//     "module": "ESNext",
//     "strict": true,          // Enable all strict checks
//     "noUncheckedIndexedAccess": true,  // Arrays may be undefined
//     "esModuleInterop": true,
//     "outDir": "./dist",
//     "rootDir": "./src"
//   },
//   "include": ["src/**/*"]
// }`,
      exercise: `**Mini Exercise:**
1. Install TypeScript globally and run \`tsc --init\` to create a tsconfig
2. Create a \`.ts\` file that declares variables of each primitive type
3. Write a function \`calculateArea(width: number, height: number): number\`
4. Try passing wrong types — observe the compile-time errors
5. Compile with \`tsc\` and inspect the generated JavaScript — notice types are gone`,

      id: "core-type-system",
      title: "Core Type System & Inference",
      explanation: `TypeScript's type system is **structural** (also called duck typing) — it cares about the **shape** of data, not its name or origin. If an object has the right properties, it's compatible, regardless of where it came from.

**Primitive types:** \`string\`, \`number\`, \`boolean\`, \`null\`, \`undefined\`, \`bigint\`, \`symbol\`
**Special types:** \`any\` (escape hatch), \`unknown\` (safe any), \`never\` (impossible), \`void\` (no return)
**Object types:** \`object\`, \`{}\`, arrays, tuples, functions

**Type Inference** is TypeScript's ability to automatically determine types without explicit annotations. TS uses **control flow analysis** to narrow types through your code.

**Structural Typing vs Nominal Typing:**
- **Structural** (TypeScript): Two types are compatible if they have the same shape/structure
- **Nominal** (Java/C#): Two types are compatible only if they have the same name/declaration

This means in TypeScript, you never need \`implements\` for a class to satisfy an interface — if it has the right shape, it works.

**Type vs Value space:** TypeScript has two parallel worlds — the **type space** (erased at runtime) and the **value space** (exists at runtime). \`interface\` and \`type\` live only in type space; \`class\` lives in both.

🏠 **Real-world analogy:** Structural typing is like a USB port. It doesn't care what brand the cable is — if the plug fits the shape (has the right pins), it works. Nominal typing would require the cable to be from the same manufacturer.`,
      codeExample: `// Primitive types
let name: string = "Alice";
let age: number = 30;
let active: boolean = true;
let big: bigint = 9007199254740991n;
let id: symbol = Symbol("id");

// Special types
let anything: any = 42;       // ⚠️ Escape hatch — disables type checking
anything = "now a string";    // No error — defeats the purpose of TS!

let safe: unknown = 42;       // ✅ Safe alternative to any
// safe.toFixed();             // ❌ Error! Must narrow first
if (typeof safe === "number") {
  safe.toFixed(2);            // ✅ After narrowing, it's safe
}

function throwError(msg: string): never {
  throw new Error(msg);       // never returns — the return type is 'never'
}

function log(msg: string): void {
  console.log(msg);           // void = no meaningful return value
}

// Type inference in action
let x = 10;                   // inferred as 'number'
let y = [1, 2, 3];           // inferred as 'number[]'
let z = { name: "Alice" };   // inferred as '{ name: string }'

// const narrows to literal types
const pi = 3.14;             // type: 3.14 (literal), not 'number'
const greeting = "hello";    // type: "hello" (literal), not 'string'

// Structural typing — shape matters, not name
interface Point {
  x: number;
  y: number;
}
function distance(p: Point): number {
  return Math.sqrt(p.x ** 2 + p.y ** 2);
}
// No 'implements Point' needed — just match the shape!
const myPoint = { x: 3, y: 4, z: 5 }; // Extra property OK
distance(myPoint); // ✅ Works! Has x and y

// Arrays and tuples
let nums: number[] = [1, 2, 3];
let pair: [string, number] = ["age", 30]; // Fixed length & types
let readonly_arr: readonly number[] = [1, 2, 3];
// readonly_arr.push(4); // ❌ Error: Property 'push' does not exist`,

      id: "interfaces-and-type-aliases",
      title: "Interfaces vs Type Aliases",
      explanation: `TypeScript provides two main ways to define object shapes: **interfaces** and **type aliases**. They overlap significantly but have key differences.

**Interface** — Defines a contract for object shapes. Can be **extended** and **merged** (declaration merging).
**Type Alias** — Creates a name for ANY type — objects, unions, intersections, primitives, tuples. Cannot be merged.

**When to use which (practical rule):**
- Use **interface** for object shapes, class contracts, and public APIs (extendable, mergeable)
- Use **type** for unions, intersections, mapped types, conditional types, and utility types
- In practice, many teams pick one and use it consistently — both work fine for objects

**Declaration merging** is unique to interfaces: if you declare the same interface name twice, TypeScript **merges** them. This is how libraries extend global types (e.g., adding properties to \`Window\`).

**\`extends\` vs \`&\` (intersection):**
- \`interface B extends A\` — creates a subtype with explicit relationship
- \`type B = A & { extra: string }\` — creates an intersection type

Both achieve similar results, but \`extends\` gives better error messages and is checked more eagerly.

🏠 **Real-world analogy:** An interface is like a job description — it lists required skills, and anyone who matches them qualifies. A type alias is like a label — you can label anything: a single item, a combination, or even a condition.`,
      codeExample: `// Interface — object shape contract
interface User {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  email: string;
  age?: number;              // Optional property
  readonly createdAt: Date;  // Cannot be modified after creation
}

// Extending interfaces
interface Admin extends User {
  role: "admin" | "superadmin";
  permissions: string[];
}

// Type alias — can describe ANY type
type ID = string | number;                // Union
type Pair<T> = [T, T];                    // Generic tuple
type Callback = (data: string) => void;   // Function type
type Status = "loading" | "success" | "error"; // String literal union

// Type alias for objects (works like interface)
type Product = {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  price: number;
};

// Intersection types (like extending)
type AdminUser = User & {
  role: string;
  permissions: string[];
};

// Declaration merging — ONLY works with interfaces
interface Window {
  myCustomProperty: string;  // Merges with the global Window interface
}

// interface + declaration merging example
interface Config {
  apiUrl: string;
}
interface Config {
  timeout: number;  // Merged! Config now has BOTH apiUrl and timeout
}
const config: Config = {
  apiUrl: "https://api.example.com",
  timeout: 5000
};

// Readonly and optional modifiers
interface Article {
  readonly id: number;
  title: string;
  content: string;
  tags?: string[];          // Optional
  readonly author: string;
}

const article: Article = {
  id: 1,
  title: "TypeScript Guide",

};
// article.id = 2;  // ❌ Error: Cannot assign to 'id' because it is read-only

      title: "Union, Intersection & Literal Types",
      explanation: `**Union types** (\`A | B\`) represent values that can be ONE OF several types. Think of it as "either/or".
**Intersection types** (\`A & B\`) combine multiple types into one that has ALL properties. Think of it as "both/and".
**Literal types** narrow a type to a specific value — not just \`string\`, but exactly \`"hello"\`.

**Union types** are everywhere in production TypeScript:
- API response states: \`"loading" | "success" | "error"\`
- Function parameters: \`string | number\`
- Nullable values: \`string | null\`

**Intersection types** combine shapes:
- \`User & Admin\` = an object with ALL properties from both
- Used for mixins, extending types, and combining capabilities

**Literal types** give extreme precision:
- \`"GET" | "POST" | "PUT" | "DELETE"\` — only these exact strings are allowed
- \`1 | 2 | 3\` — only these exact numbers
- Combined with unions, they create **discriminated unions** — one of TypeScript's most powerful patterns

**Discriminated Unions:** A union where each member has a common property (the "discriminant") with a unique literal type. TypeScript uses this to narrow the union in switch/if statements.

🏠 **Real-world analogy:** A union type is like a parking space labeled "Cars OR Motorcycles" — it accepts either. An intersection type is like a job requirement "Must have Engineering AND MBA" — need both. Literal types are like a vending machine button for a specific item — only that exact selection works.`,

type StringOrNumber = string | number;

  if (typeof value === "string") {

      title: "Functions, Overloads & Typing Patterns",
      explanation: `TypeScript provides rich typing for functions — from basic parameter/return types to generics, overloads, and advanced patterns like \`this\` typing.

**Function type expressions:** \`(param: Type) => ReturnType\`
**Optional and default parameters:** \`param?: Type\` or \`param: Type = defaultValue\`
**Rest parameters:** \`...args: Type[]\`
**Function overloads:** Multiple signatures for different input/output combinations

**Function Overloads** let you define multiple call signatures for a single function. The compiler chooses the right signature based on the arguments. The implementation signature must be compatible with ALL overload signatures.

**\`this\` typing:** TypeScript can type the \`this\` parameter explicitly — useful for callbacks that need a specific context.

**Callback typing patterns:**
- \`(data: T) => void\` — Standard callback
- \`(err: Error | null, data?: T) => void\` — Node.js error-first callback
- \`() => Promise<T>\` — Async factory

🏠 **Real-world analogy:** Function overloads are like a Swiss Army knife — the same tool (function name) provides different tools (behavior) depending on how you open it (what arguments you pass).`,
      codeExample: `// Basic function typing
function add(a: number, b: number): number {
  return a + b;
}

// Arrow function type
const multiply: (a: number, b: number) => number = (a, b) => a * b;

// Optional and default parameters
function greet(name: string, greeting: string = "Hello"): string {
  return \`\${greeting}, \${name}!\`;
}
greet("Alice");           // "Hello, Alice!"
greet("Alice", "Hola");  // "Hola, Alice!"

// Rest parameters
function sum(...numbers: number[]): number {
  return numbers.reduce((acc, n) => acc + n, 0);
}

// ⭐ Function Overloads
function createElement(tag: "a"): HTMLAnchorElement;
function createElement(tag: "canvas"): HTMLCanvasElement;
function createElement(tag: "input"): HTMLInputElement;
function createElement(tag: string): HTMLElement;
function createElement(tag: string): HTMLElement {
  return document.createElement(tag);
}
const anchor = createElement("a");    // Type: HTMLAnchorElement
const canvas = createElement("canvas"); // Type: HTMLCanvasElement

// Practical overload: different return based on input
function parseInput(input: string): string;
function parseInput(input: number): number;
function parseInput(input: string | number): string | number {
  if (typeof input === "string") return input.trim();
  return Math.round(input);
}

// Typing 'this'
interface Button {
  label: string;
  onClick(this: Button): void;
}
const button: Button = {
  label: "Submit",
  onClick() {
    console.log(this.label); // 'this' is typed as Button
  }
};

// Generic function (preview — deep dive in Phase 2)
function identity<T>(value: T): T {
  return value;
}
const str = identity("hello"); // Type: string
const num = identity(42);       // Type: number

// Function type with generics
type Mapper<T, U> = (item: T, index: number) => U;
const toLength: Mapper<string, number> = (s) => s.length;

// Void vs undefined return
type VoidFn = () => void;
const fn: VoidFn = () => { return true; }; // ✅ No error! void ignores return
// This is intentional — allows array.forEach() to accept callbacks that return values`,
      exercise: `**Mini Exercise:**
1. Write overloaded function signatures for a \`format\` function that accepts string → string or number → string
2. Create a typed callback pattern: \`function fetchData(url: string, cb: (err: Error | null, data?: string) => void)\`
3. Type a method with explicit \`this\` parameter for a class-like object
4. Write a generic identity function and observe how TypeScript infers \`T\`
5. Explain why \`() => void\` allows returning values but \`() => undefined\` does not`,

      id: "enums-tuples-special-types",
      title: "Enums, Tuples & Special Types",
      explanation: `**Enums** define a set of named constants. TypeScript has **numeric enums**, **string enums**, and **const enums**.

**Tuples** are fixed-length arrays where each position has a specific type. They're like arrays with a known structure.

**Special types** round out TypeScript's type system — \`as const\`, assertion functions, branded types, and more.

**Enum debate:** Many TypeScript experts (including the TS team) now recommend **union literal types** or **\`as const\` objects** over enums because:
- Enums generate runtime JavaScript code (they're not type-only)
- \`const enum\` is fragile across module boundaries
- Union literals are zero-cost and tree-shakeable

**Tuples** are critical for:
- React hooks: \`useState\` returns \`[T, SetterFn]\`
- Coordinate data: \`[number, number]\`
- Function overloads with variadic args
- Named tuples for readability: \`[name: string, age: number]\`

**\`as const\`** creates the narrowest possible type — all properties become \`readonly\` and values become literal types. This is how you create type-safe constant objects.

🏠 **Real-world analogy:** An enum is like a menu with numbered items — "1. Coffee, 2. Tea, 3. Water". \`as const\` is like a menu printed on a brass plaque — it's fixed, permanent, and everyone sees exactly the same options.`,
      codeExample: `// Numeric Enum (auto-increments from 0)
enum Direction {
  Up,     // 0
  Down,   // 1
  Left,   // 2
  Right   // 3
}
console.log(Direction.Up);    // 0
console.log(Direction[0]);    // "Up" (reverse mapping)

// String Enum (recommended over numeric)
enum Status {
  Active = "ACTIVE",
  Inactive = "INACTIVE",
  Pending = "PENDING"
}

// ⚠️ Enums generate runtime code:
// var Status;
// (function (Status) {
//   Status["Active"] = "ACTIVE";
//   ...
// })(Status || (Status = {}));

// ✅ Better alternative: union literal types (zero-cost)
type StatusType = "ACTIVE" | "INACTIVE" | "PENDING";

// ✅ Or: as const object (runtime values + type safety)
const STATUS = {
  Active: "ACTIVE",
  Inactive: "INACTIVE",
  Pending: "PENDING"
} as const;
type StatusValue = typeof STATUS[keyof typeof STATUS];
// "ACTIVE" | "INACTIVE" | "PENDING"

// Tuples — fixed length, typed positions
let point: [number, number] = [10, 20];
let entry: [string, number] = ["age", 30];

// Named tuples (TypeScript 4.0+) — for readability
type UserTuple = [name: string, age: number, active: boolean];
const user: UserTuple = ["Alice", 30, true];

// Rest elements in tuples
type StringAndNumbers = [string, ...number[]];
const data: StringAndNumbers = ["scores", 90, 85, 95];

// React useState pattern
function useState<T>(initial: T): [T, (value: T) => void] {
  let state = initial;
  const setState = (value: T) => { state = value; };
  return [state, setState];
}
const [count, setCount] = useState(0); // Properly typed!

// as const — creates the narrowest type
const CONFIG = {
  api: "https://api.example.com",
  timeout: 5000,
  retries: 3,
  methods: ["GET", "POST"]  // readonly ["GET", "POST"], not string[]
} as const;
// CONFIG.timeout = 10000;  // ❌ Error: readonly
// type: { readonly api: "https://..."; readonly timeout: 5000; ... }

// Const assertions with arrays
const ROLES = ["admin", "editor", "viewer"] as const;
type Role = typeof ROLES[number]; // "admin" | "editor" | "viewer"

// Assertion functions
function assertIsString(value: unknown): asserts value is string {
  if (typeof value !== "string") {
    throw new Error(\`Expected string, got \${typeof value}\`);
  }
}
function process(input: unknown) {
  assertIsString(input);
  console.log(input.toUpperCase()); // TS knows input is string!
}`,

1. Create both an enum and an \`as const\` object for roles — compare the compiled JavaScript output
2. Declare a tuple type for a database row: \`[id: number, name: string, email: string, active: boolean]\`
3. Use \`as const\` to create a readonly config object and derive a union type from its values
4. Write an assertion function \`assertNonNull<T>(value: T | null): asserts value is T\`
5. Use rest elements in a tuple: \`[first: string, ...rest: number[]]\``,
