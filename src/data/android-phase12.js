      explanation: `**Coding round simulation** — practice exactly like the real interview. Use a plain text editor, set a 45-minute timer, and solve 2 problems.

**Google coding interview format:**
- 45 minutes, 2 problems (sometimes 1 hard problem)
- Typically: 1 medium + 1 medium, or 1 medium + 1 hard
- Language: Kotlin preferred for Android candidates
- Environment: Google Docs or simple code editor (no autocomplete!)

**Evaluation rubric (how Google scores):**
\`\`\`
1. Problem Solving (40%):
   - Correctly identifies the approach
   - Handles edge cases
   - Optimizes when prompted
   
2. Coding (30%):
   - Clean, readable code
   - Proper variable names
   - Idiomatic Kotlin/language usage
   
3. Communication (20%):
   - Explains thought process
   - Responds well to hints
   - Discusses trade-offs
   
4. Verification (10%):
   - Tests with examples
   - Identifies edge cases
   - Catches bugs before prompted
\`\`\`

**Simulated practice rounds:**

**Round 1 (Medium + Medium):**
- Problem A: Given a list of transactions with amounts and categories, find the top K categories by total spending
- Problem B: Given a binary tree, find all paths that sum to a target value

**Round 2 (Medium + Hard):**
- Problem A: Implement a class that schedules delayed tasks with cancellation support
- Problem B: Given a grid of characters and a dictionary, find all words that can be formed by adjacent cells`,
      codeExample: `// SIMULATION: Round 1, Problem A
// "Find top K categories by total spending"
// Input: transactions = [("food", 50), ("transport", 30), ("food", 20), 
//        ("entertainment", 100), ("transport", 40)], K = 2
// Output: ["entertainment", "transport"]

// Step 1: Think aloud — "I need to group by category, sum amounts,
// then find top K. I'll use a HashMap + heap."

// Step 2: State complexity — O(n + m log k) where n=transactions, m=categories

// Step 3: Code
fun topKCategories(transactions: List<Pair<String, Int>>, k: Int): List<String> {
    // Group by category and sum
    val categoryTotals = transactions
        .groupBy { it.first }
        .mapValues { (_, txns) -> txns.sumOf { it.second } }
    
    // Use min-heap of size k for top-K
    val minHeap = PriorityQueue<Pair<String, Int>>(compareBy { it.second })
    for ((category, total) in categoryTotals) {
        minHeap.offer(category to total)
        if (minHeap.size > k) minHeap.poll()
    }
    
    // Extract results in descending order
    return minHeap.sortedByDescending { it.second }.map { it.first }
}

// Step 4: Test
// transactions = [("food",50), ("transport",30), ("food",20), 
//                 ("entertainment",100), ("transport",40)]
// categoryTotals = {food:70, transport:70, entertainment:100}
// After heap with k=2: [transport:70, entertainment:100]
// Result: ["entertainment", "transport"] ✓

// Step 5: Edge cases
// - Empty list → return empty
// - K > number of categories → return all categories
// - Tie in amounts → either is acceptable

// SIMULATION: Round 1, Problem B
// "Find all paths in binary tree that sum to target"
fun pathSum(root: TreeNode?, target: Int): List<List<Int>> {
    val result = mutableListOf<List<Int>>()
    
    fun dfs(node: TreeNode?, remaining: Int, path: MutableList<Int>) {
        if (node == null) return
        path.add(node.value)
        if (node.left == null && node.right == null && remaining == node.value) {
            result.add(path.toList())
        }
        dfs(node.left, remaining - node.value, path)
        dfs(node.right, remaining - node.value, path)
        path.removeAt(path.lastIndex) // Backtrack
    }
    
    dfs(root, target, mutableListOf())
    return result
}

STEP 3: DATA MODEL (5 min)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Photo entity:
  - id (UUID)
  - localPath (String?)
  - remotePath (String?)
  - thumbnailPath (String?)
  - dateTaken (Long)
  - location (lat/lng?)
  - width, height (Int)
  - syncState (SYNCED | PENDING | UPLOADING | FAILED)
  - fileSize (Long)

STEP 4: KEY COMPONENTS DEEP DIVE (15 min)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Image Loading:
  - Coil with 3 layers: memory cache → disk cache → network
  - Generate thumbnails on capture (200x200)
  - Load full resolution only on detail view
  - Recycle bitmap memory when scrolling

Sync Engine:
  - WorkManager with UNMETERED + NOT_LOW_BATTERY constraints
  - Upload queue: new photos added to pending table
  - Upload process: compress → upload → update syncState
  - Delta sync: fetch new photos from server since lastSyncToken
  - Conflict: server version wins (photos are immutable after capture)

Pagination:
  - Room PagingSource for local photos (date descending)
  - RemoteMediator for cloud photos (lazy download)

STEP 5: TRADE-OFFS (5 min)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
- Full vs compressed sync: upload original + generate cloud thumbnails
  vs upload compressed only → chose original for quality
- Sync immediately vs batched: batched saves battery, slight delay ok
- Room metadata vs file-based: Room for fast queries, files for images

      explanation: `**The Android deep dive round** is unique to Android roles at Google. The interviewer tests your depth of knowledge on Android internals, architecture, and production experience.

**Format:**
- 45 minutes
- Starts with a broad question, then drills deeper
- Tests both theoretical knowledge and practical experience
- Expects you to draw from production experience

**Common deep dive flows:**

**Flow 1: Activity → Lifecycle → Process Death → State Restoration**
"Tell me about Activity lifecycle..."
→ "What happens during configuration change?"
→ "How does the system handle process death?"
→ "What data survives process death?"
→ "How would you handle a multi-step form across process death?"

**Flow 2: Coroutines → Dispatchers → Cancellation → Testing**
"How do coroutines work internally?"
→ "Explain the dispatcher system"
→ "How does structured concurrency handle cancellation?"
→ "How do you test coroutines?"
→ "What are common pitfalls?"

**Flow 3: Compose → Recomposition → Performance → State**
"How does Compose rendering work?"
→ "What triggers recomposition?"
→ "How do you optimize recomposition?"
→ "Explain remember and derivedStateOf"
→ "How do you handle side effects?"

**Flow 4: Architecture → Repository → Offline → Sync**
"Describe your app's architecture..."
→ "How does the data layer work?"
→ "How do you handle offline mode?"
→ "How do you sync data?"
→ "How do you handle conflicts?"

**Preparation tip:** For each topic, prepare to go 3-4 levels deep. If you can explain the WHY behind every design decision, you're ready.`,
      codeExample: `// Deep dive simulation: "Explain how Jetpack Compose rendering works"

/*
LEVEL 1: Basic understanding
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
"Compose is a declarative UI framework. You describe WHAT the UI
should look like for a given state, and Compose handles the HOW.
When state changes, Compose re-executes (recomposes) only the 
composable functions that read that state."

LEVEL 2: Recomposition mechanics
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
"The Compose compiler plugin transforms @Composable functions 
to track which state they read. When state changes, Compose's 
snapshot system detects it and schedules recomposition. The 
Composer maintains a slot table — a flat array of data from the 
previous composition. During recomposition, it compares the new 
data with the slot table to determine what changed."

LEVEL 3: Optimization — skipping recomposition
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
"Compose can skip recomposition of a composable if ALL its 
parameters are 'stable' and haven't changed (equals() returns true).
The @Stable and @Immutable annotations tell the compiler that a type's
equals() is reliable. Primitive types and String are stable by default.
Unstable types (List, custom classes without @Stable) force recomposition
even if values haven't changed."

LEVEL 4: Performance debugging
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
"Use the Compose compiler metrics (-Pcompile.metrics=true) to 
see which composables are skippable, restartable, and which 
parameters are stable. Use Layout Inspector's recomposition
counter to see which composables recompose most. Common 
optimizations: (1) Use remember to cache expensive computations.
(2) Use derivedStateOf for computed values. (3) Defer state reads 
to the composition phase using Modifier.drawWithContent or 
snapshotFlow. (4) Use key() in LazyColumn for stable keys."
