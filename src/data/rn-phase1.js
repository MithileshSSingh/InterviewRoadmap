      title: "Senior vs Staff: What Companies Expect",
      explanation: `**Senior React Native Engineer (IC3–IC4 / L5–L6)** is expected to independently own large features end-to-end, make sound architectural decisions within a team, mentor junior/mid engineers, and ship production-quality code at scale without handholding.

**Staff React Native Engineer (IC5 / L6–L7)** transcends a single team. You're expected to:
- **Set technical direction** across multiple teams or an entire mobile platform
- **Define architectural standards** that scale across 10+ engineers
- **Influence without authority** — drive alignment between iOS, Android, backend, and design
- **Anticipate problems 6–12 months ahead** and build systems to prevent them
- **Reduce organizational complexity** through platform abstractions, shared libraries, and tooling

**Key differentiators at top companies (Meta, Airbnb, Coinbase, Shopify):**

| Dimension | Senior | Staff |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Scope | Single team, 1–2 features | Cross-team, platform-level |
| Architecture | Follows/adapts patterns | Defines/evolves patterns |
| Code Review | Reviews PRs for correctness | Reviews for architectural alignment |
| Decision Making | Makes decisions within team | Makes decisions that affect the org |
| Mentoring | Helps individuals | Elevates entire team's bar |
| Tech Debt | Identifies and fixes | Creates strategies to prevent |
| Communication | Team standups, sprint demos | Architecture reviews, RFCs, tech talks |
| Impact | Feature delivery | Platform capability, developer velocity |

**What gets you promoted from Senior to Staff:**
1. You solve problems nobody asked you to solve — but everyone needed
2. Your abstractions and patterns are adopted by teams you've never spoken to
3. Engineers across the org cite your RFCs, code, or documentation
4. You reduce the total complexity of the system, not just your part
5. Leadership trusts you to make irreversible technical decisions`,
      codeExample: `// Senior-level: Owns a well-structured feature module
// Staff-level: Creates the abstraction that makes all feature modules consistent

      title: "Interview Round Structure at Top Companies",
      explanation: `**Senior/Staff React Native interviews** at top product companies typically span 4–6 rounds over 1–2 days. Understanding each round's evaluation criteria is critical for targeted preparation.

**Typical pipeline at top companies (Meta, Airbnb, Coinbase, Shopify, Stripe):**

**1. Recruiter Screen (30 min)**
- Background, motivations, compensation expectations
- High-level technical discussion (not coding)
- They're evaluating communication and leveling

**2. Technical Phone Screen (45–60 min)**
- Live coding on CoderPad/HackerRank
- 1–2 medium-difficulty problems
- Clean code, communication, edge cases
- For Staff: may include architecture discussion

**3. On-site Loop (4–5 rounds, 45–60 min each):**

| Round | What's Tested | Senior Expectation | Staff Expectation |
|-------|--------------|-------------------|------------------|
| Coding 1 | Algorithms & DS | Optimal solution, clean code | + Trade-off discussion, scalability |
| Coding 2 | Practical/System | React Native specific coding | + Architecture of the solution |
| System Design | Mobile architecture | Drive the design with trade-offs | Define the design, anticipate future needs |
| Deep Dive | RN internals, performance | Explain mechanisms, debug scenarios | + Cross-platform strategy, platform decisions |
| Behavioral | Leadership, conflict | Team-level impact stories | Org-level impact, tech vision |

**4. Hiring Committee / Debrief**
- Interviewers present feedback independently
- Leveling discussion — Senior vs Staff signal
- Any red flags from any round can block

**Company-specific nuances:**
- **Meta**: Heavy focus on coding (Leetcode Medium-Hard) + product sense for mobile
- **Airbnb**: Values cultural fit heavily — dedicated "culture interview" round
- **Coinbase**: Crypto/fintech domain knowledge, security-first architecture
- **Shopify**: Mobile platform thinking, dev tooling, React Native specific depth
- **Stripe**: API design excellence, reliability engineering mindset

**Staff-specific interview additions:**
- Architecture presentation (bring your own design)
- Cross-functional alignment scenarios
- Technical vision and strategy discussions
- Code review exercise (review someone else's code)`,
      codeExample: `// What interviewers look for in your CODING rounds:

// ❌ Junior/Mid approach — works but shows no maturity
function findDuplicates(arr) {
  const dupes = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    for (let j = i + 1; j < arr.length; j++) {
      if (arr[i] === arr[j] && !dupes.includes(arr[i])) {
        dupes.push(arr[i]);
      }
    }
  }
  return dupes; // O(n³) — includes() is O(n) inside O(n²)
}

// ✅ Senior approach — optimal, clean, explains trade-offs
function findDuplicates(arr: number[]): number[] {
  // Approach: frequency map → filter entries with count > 1
  // Time: O(n), Space: O(n)
  const freq = new Map<number, number>();
  const result: number[] = [];
  
  for (const num of arr) {
    const count = (freq.get(num) ?? 0) + 1;
    freq.set(num, count);
    // Add to result exactly when we see the second occurrence
    if (count === 2) result.push(num);
  }
  
  return result;
}

// ✅ Staff approach — same solution BUT discusses:
// 1. "If the array doesn't fit in memory, I'd use external sort + streaming"
// 2. "If we need this in a hot path, we could use a BitSet for integers in a known range"
// 3. "In production, I'd add input validation and consider the API contract"
// 4. "This pattern is similar to our deduplication logic in the sync engine"

// ----- SYSTEM DESIGN round example prompt -----
// "Design a real-time messaging system for React Native"
// 
// Senior drives: architecture diagram, data models, offline queue
// Staff drives: + multi-device sync, E2E encryption strategy, 
//   message delivery guarantees, platform abstraction for web+mobile`,
      exercise: `**Interview Preparation Exercises:**
1. Practice 2 Leetcode Medium problems daily for 30 days — narrate your thought process aloud
2. Design 3 mobile systems end-to-end: messaging app, e-commerce app, social feed
3. Prepare 8 STAR stories covering: leadership, conflict, failure, mentoring, ambiguity, cross-team impact, technical trade-off, production incident
4. Mock interview with a peer — alternate interviewer/candidate roles
5. Practice writing code in a shared Google Doc or CoderPad (no autocomplete)
6. Record yourself explaining React Native's new architecture in 5 minutes — review for clarity
7. Write a 2-page technical vision document for a hypothetical mobile platform
8. Prepare a 10-minute architecture presentation of your most impactful project`,
      commonMistakes: [
        "Preparing only for coding and ignoring system design — at Senior+, system design carries equal or more weight",
        "Not calibrating to the company's specific interview format — Meta is coding-heavy, Airbnb is culture-heavy",

(2) **Clarify non-functional requirements** — 'What's our scale? Latency expectations? Offline support needed?' (3) **Define scope** — 'For this discussion, I'll focus on X and Y, and leave Z for a follow-up.' (4) **State assumptions** — 'I'm assuming we have 1M DAU with 10% concurrent.'

          type: "conceptual",
          q: "What signals does an interviewer look for to differentiate Senior from Staff?",
          a: "**Senior signals**: Drives the conversation independently, provides optimal solutions, discusses trade-offs when asked, handles edge cases proactively, communicates clearly. **Staff signals**: Thinks about the problem in a broader context ('How does this affect other teams?'), proactively discusses scalability and future evolution, considers organizational constraints ('Who maintains this?'), proposes monitoring and observability, challenges assumptions in the problem statement, and can zoom in/out between low-level implementation and high-level strategy seamlessly.",

        {
          type: "scenario",
          q: "You're in a behavioral round. The interviewer asks: 'Tell me about a time you disagreed with your manager about a technical decision.' How do you structure your answer?",
          a: "Use STAR with emphasis on **respectful disagreement and data-driven resolution**: **S**: 'My manager wanted to adopt GraphQL for our React Native app's API layer mid-release cycle.' **T**: 'I was responsible for the mobile client and was concerned about the impact on our timeline and the team's learning curve.' **A**: 'I prepared a comparison document: REST vs GraphQL for our specific use case, including bundle size impact, caching complexity, and team ramp-up time. I proposed a phased approach: GraphQL for new endpoints only, with a compatibility layer. I scheduled a 1:1 to present my analysis.' **R**: 'My manager agreed to the phased approach. We shipped on time, and eventually migrated 70% of endpoints over 2 quarters. The key was framing it as risk mitigation, not disagreement.'",

      id: "technical-leadership-expectations",
      title: "Technical Leadership & Architecture Ownership",
      explanation: `**Technical leadership in React Native** goes beyond writing code. At Senior+ level, you're expected to own the mobile platform's technical direction, make decisions that trade off short-term velocity for long-term sustainability, and ensure the architecture supports the team's growth.

**Architecture Ownership means:**
1. **You define the patterns** — folder structure, state management approach, navigation architecture, API integration layer
2. **You enforce consistency** — through code reviews, lint rules, and shared libraries
3. **You anticipate scale** — designing for 10x users, 10x engineers, 10x features
4. **You manage migration paths** — upgrading React Native versions, adopting new architectures, deprecating legacy patterns
5. **You document decisions** — ADRs (Architecture Decision Records), RFCs, design docs

**Cross-team alignment responsibilities (Staff level):**
- Align with iOS/Android native teams on shared feature parity
- Coordinate with backend teams on API contracts and data models
- Work with design systems team on component library standards
- Collaborate with platform/infra on CI/CD, monitoring, and release processes
- Align with product on technical feasibility and timeline implications

**Decision-making authority:**

| Decision Type | Senior | Staff |
|--------------|--------|-------|
| Library choice within team | ✅ Own | ✅ Own |
| Architecture pattern for team | ✅ Own | ✅ Own |
| Cross-team library adoption | 🔶 Propose | ✅ Own & drive |
| RN version upgrade strategy | 🔶 Contribute | ✅ Own & lead |
| Build/CI pipeline architecture | 🔶 Contribute | ✅ Own & define |
| Platform-level abstractions | 🔶 Use | ✅ Design & build |
| Vendor evaluation (Sentry, CodePush) | 🔶 Provide input | ✅ Evaluate & decide |

**The RFC process (how Staff engineers drive decisions):**
1. **Problem Statement** — What's broken/missing and why it matters
2. **Proposed Solution** — Architecture, code examples, migration plan
3. **Alternatives Considered** — Why other approaches were rejected
4. **Trade-offs** — What we gain and what we sacrifice
5. **Rollout Plan** — Phased adoption, feature flags, rollback strategy
6. **Success Metrics** — How we know this worked (perf, DX, incidents)`,
      codeExample: `// Architecture Decision Record (ADR) Example
// This is how Staff engineers document technical decisions

/**
 * ADR-007: Adopt Zustand for Feature-Level State Management
 * 
 * Status: Accepted
 * Date: 2025-01-15
 * Decision Makers: [Staff Eng, Tech Lead, Senior Eng]
 * 
 * Context:
 * - Current Redux store has 45 slices, 12K lines
 * - Bundle impact: redux + toolkit + saga = 42KB gzipped
 * - New engineers take 2 weeks to understand the state architecture
 * - Feature teams frequently cause cross-feature state bugs
 * 
 * Decision:
 * - Use Zustand for NEW feature-level state (isolated per feature)
 * - Keep Redux for cross-cutting global state (auth, config, theme)
 * - Migrate existing features incrementally (priority: most-changed first)
 * 
 * Trade-offs:
 * + Zustand: 1.2KB, zero boilerplate, TypeScript-native
 * + Feature isolation: no cross-feature state leaks
 * + Faster onboarding: Zustand is simpler mental model
 * - Two state management patterns in codebase (temporary)
 * - Need migration tooling / codemods
 * - Middleware patterns differ from Redux
 * 
 * Migration Plan:
 * Phase 1: New features use Zustand (enforce via lint rule)
 * Phase 2: Migrate top 5 most-changed features (Q1)
 * Phase 3: Migrate remaining features (Q2-Q3)
 * Phase 4: Remove Redux dependency (Q4 stretch goal)
 * 
 * Success Metrics:
 * - Feature state bugs reduced by 50% (from 12/quarter to 6)
 * - New feature setup time < 30 minutes (currently 2 hours)
 * - Bundle size reduction: 40KB (after full migration)
